## Objective

This A/B testing experiemnt aims to analyze the impact of website background color on user engagement and conversion rates. Specifically, I compare a white background (Group A, control group) with a black background (Group B, treatment group) to determine whether the change in design improves user interaction and the liklihood of conversions

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarsh0806/ab-testing-practice/data). This is a synthetic dataset generated using random sampling techniques from the Python NumPy package. It simulates user activity on an imaginery retail website operating across different locations in the United Kingdom.

## Experiemental Design

- Control Group (A - White Background): Represents the default website setting.
- Treament Group (B - Black Blackground): Represents the newly tested setting.

Research Question: *Does changing the website background color influence user engangement and conversion rates*

## Key Variables in the Dataset

- User ID: Unique identifer for each user
- Group: Indicator whether the user was in Group A (White Background) or Group B (Black Background)
- Page Views: Number of pages viewed during the user's session
- Time Spend (seconds): The total duartion the suer spent on the website
- Conversion: Whether the user completed a desired action (e.g. purchase, signup, etc.) (Yes/No)
- Device: Type of device used (e.g. Mobile, Desktop)
- Location: The country in the UK where the user is based 

## Statistical Methods Used

To evaluate the impact of the background color change, I used: 

- T-Test to compare the average time spent on the website between the tewo groups.
- Chi-Square Test  to analyze differences in conversion rates between the groups. 

## Significance of the Study

A/B test is a crucial tool in user experience (UX) optimizatino and digital marketing. Findings from analysis such as this could help business make data-driven design decisions that enhance user engagement and improve conversion rates. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import os
os.getcwd()
df = pd.read_csv(
    'c:\\Users\\HoraceTsai\\Documents\\data\\ab_testing.csv'
)
df.head()

```
## Methodology and Analysis

To help us understand whether a black background (Group B) leads to better user engagement and conversions ocmpared to a white background (Group A), the following analysis was performed: 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before conducting any statistical test, I explored the dataset to understand its structure and key distributions:

- Summary statistics were calculated for **time spent** on the website accross both groups
- boxplots and histograms were used to visualize the distribution of time spent
- Bar charts were created to compare conversion rates between groups

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import scipy.stats as stats

summary_stats = df.groupby("Group")["Time Spent"].describe()
summary_stats

#plot 
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.boxplot(
    x = "Group",
    y = "Time Spent",
    data = df,
    order = ["A", "B"],
    palette = "Accent"
)
plt.title("Distribution of Time Spent by Group")
plt.xlabel("Group")
plt.ylabel("Time Spent (seconds)")
plt.grid(False)
plt.show()
```

```{python}
#plot 
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.histplot(
    df,
    x = "Time Spent",
    hue = "Group",
    kde = True,
    bins = 30,
    palette = "Accent",
    alpha = 0.6,
)
plt.title("Distribution of Time Spent by Group")
plt.xlabel("Group")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.legend(title="Group", 
    labels=["A (White Background)", "B (Black Background)"], 
    loc='upper left',
    bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1)
    )
plt.grid(False)
plt.show()
# fairly similar distribution
```

### Hypothesis Testing 

```{python}
group_A = df[df["Group"] == "A"]["Time Spent"]
group_B = df[df["Group"] == "B"]["Time Spent"]

t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(
    group_A, 
    group_B,
    equal_var = False
    )

print(t_stat, p_val)
# small t- stat meaning group a (white) has a slightly higher mean of time spent vs group B
# however difference between the two gorups is not large compared to the variability of the data
# therefore no signif diff between background colors 
# changing website background does not meaningfully affect how long users stay
```

```{python}
# Convert Conversion column to binary (Yes = 1, No = 0)
df["Conversion"] = df["Conversion"].map({"Yes": 1, "No": 0})
```

```{python}
# Calculate conversion rates for each group
conversion_rates = df.groupby("Group")["Conversion"].mean().reset_index()

# bar plot for conversion rates
plt.figure(figsize =(8,5))
sns.barplot(
    x = "Group",
    y = "Conversion",
    data = conversion_rates,
    palette = "Accent"
)

# Add annotations
for index, row in conversion_rates.iterrows():
    plt.text(index, row["Conversion"] + 0.01, f"{row['Conversion']*100:.2f}%", ha='center', fontsize=12)

# Formatting the plot
plt.title("Conversion Rate by Group (A vs. B)")
plt.xlabel("Group")
plt.ylabel("Conversion Rate")
plt.ylim(0, 1)  # Ensuring y-axis goes from 0 to 1 (100% scale)
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

```{python}
# Perform a chi-square test for conversion rates
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(df["Group"], df["Conversion"])
chi2_stat, p_value, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

# Display conversion rates and test results
chi2_stat, p_value
```
