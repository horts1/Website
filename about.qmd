## About Me

Welcome to my professional portfolio! I am Horace Tsai, a recent graduate from California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) with a Master of Science in Statistics. In 2019, received my Bachelor of Arts in Economics with a double minor in Accounting and Statistics at the University of California, Irvine (UCI).

Currently, I am working as an Associate Program Manager, where I leverage my analytics skills and passion for data to impactfully drive projects and deliver actionable insights.

During my time at CSUF, I developed a strong foundation in statistical theory, data analysis, and machine learning. My academic journey was filled with hands-on projects that honed my ability to turn complex data into clear, meaningful narratives. Whether it's through advanced statistical modeling, data visualization, or predictive analytics, I strive to uncover patterns and insights that can drive better decision-making.

My professional aspiration is to transition into a full-fledged data scientist role. I am eager to apply my skills in a more focused data-centric capacity, tackling challenging problems and contributing to innovative solutions. On this website, you'll find a showcase of my past projects, each demonstrating my proficiency in various statistical and analytical techniques, as well as my commitment to continuous learning and growth.

From exploratory data analysis to building machine learning models, my projects highlight my technical expertise and my ability to translate data into strategic business value. I invite you to explore my work, and I am always open to connecting with like-minded professionals and potential collaborators.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing my findings with you!
